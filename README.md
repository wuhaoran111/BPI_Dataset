# BPI_Dataset

This is the BPI dataset captured by Tsinghua University for pedestrian behavior recognition, intention recognition and trajectory prediction.

The prefix of the csv files shows which scenario this sequance belongs to in eight scenarios we defined. Each csv file includes a sequance of trajectories and 18 key points of the pedestrian. The state of vehicle is also included. The explanations of variables are shown in 'explain.csv'.

The sample data and images from the camera and lidar are proposed in the file named 'raw_data'. For all the collected data, you can visit https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/535010e2a50a496cbc96/ for more information.

Cyclists crossing intersection trajectories are also included in the csv file. But images are not updated now.
