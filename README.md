# BPI_Dataset

This is the BPI dataset captured by Tsinghua University for pedestrian trajectory prediction.

The prefix of the csv files shows which scenario this sequance belongs to in eight scenarios we define in the paper.

Each csv file includes a sequance of trajectories and 18 key points of the pedestrian. The state of vehicle is also included.

The explanations of variables are shown in 'explain.csv'.

The images from the camera and lidar are in the file named 'raw_data'.

Cyclists crossing intersection trajectories are also included in the csv file. But images are not updated.
