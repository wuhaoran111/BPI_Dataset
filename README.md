# BPI_Dataset

This is the BPI dataset captured by Tsinghua University for pedestrian behavior recognition, intention recognition and trajectory prediction.

The prefix of the CSV files shows which scenario this sequence belongs to in eight scenarios we defined in the research 'Crossing-Road Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Intention and Behavior Identification'. Each CSV file includes a sequence of trajectories and 18 key points of the pedestrian. The states of the vehicle are also included. The explanations of variables are shown in 'explain.csv'.

The sample data and images from the camera and lidar are proposed in the folder named 'raw_data'. For all the collected sequences, you can visit https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/535010e2a50a496cbc96/ for more information.

Cyclists crossing intersection trajectories are also included in the CSV files. The raw data will be updated later.
